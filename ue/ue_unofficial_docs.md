   * Asset Registry is an editor subsystem; The Content Browser is the primary consumer
   * `FAssetRegistryModule& AssetRegistryModule = FModuleManager::LoadModuleChecked<FAssetRegistryModule>("AssetRegistry");`
   * Obtaining a List of Assets: `AssetRegistryModule.Get().GetAssetsByClass()`
   * GetAssetsByPackageName/GetAssetsByPath/GetAssetByObjectPath/GetAssetsByTagValues/GetAllAssets
   * Converting FAssetData to UObject*: GetAsset() will load asset
   * Creating a Filter: FARFilter
   * Tags and Values: FAssetData::TagsAndValues - AssetRegistrySearchable + virtual GetAssetRegistryTags
   * Asynchronous Data Gathering
   * The LoadModule() call will block until the gather is complete

   * FKismetFunctionContext : Holds the information for compiling a single function
   * FKismetCompiledStatement : Unit of work in the compiler. The compiler translates nodes into a set of compiled statements, which the backend translates into bytecode operations
   * FKismetTerm : A terminal in the graph (literal, const, or variable reference)
   * You can also make your own terms in a NodeHandlingFunctor for scratch variables, intermediate results, etc
   * Clean the Class: CleanAndSanitizeClass(), reset UBlueprintGeneratedClass 
   * Create Class Properties: creates UProperties on the UClass's scope; CreateClassVariablesFromBlueprint()

   * Process Event Graphs: CreateAndProcessUberGraph()/FKismetFunctionContext 
   * Process Function Graphs: ProcessOneFunctionGraph()/FKismetFunctionContext
   * Pre-compile Functions: PrecompileFunction() 
   * Bind and Link the Class: compiler is aware of all of the UProperties and UFunctions for the class + Class Default Object (CDO)
   * Compile Functions: Compile()
   * Finish Compiling Class
   * Backend Emits Generated Code: FKismetCompilerVMBackend - Converts FKCS to UnrealScript VM bytecode which are then serialized into the function's script array
   * Copy Class Default Object Properties
   * Re-instance: re-instance all objects with the class that were just compiled; uses a TObjectIterator to find all instances of the class, spawn a new one/etc.

     * Console variable should reflect the user input, not necessarily the state of the system

   * Optional parameters are handled well in Blueprints
   * Favor functions with lots of return parameters over functions that return structs
   * Adding new parameters to an existing function is fine, but if you need to remove or change them, you should deprecate the original and add a new function
   * If a function needs to take an enum, consider using the 'expand enum as execs'
   * operations that take time to complete (e.g. move here) should be latent functions
   * mark nodes as pure if possible, as this will avoid needing an execution pin on a node that requires wiring
   * Marking a function as const will also cause the Blueprint node to not have execution pins
   * if you're doing something that requires a lot of calculations, or operates at a high frequency, it might be better to use C++ instead of Blueprints

   * Readable and Writable Properties: BlueprintReadOnly/BlueprintReadWrite/BlueprintAssignable (for Multicast Delegate)
   * To make a parameter pass by reference and still display as an input, use the UPARAM(ref) macro
   * use UPARAM() to change the display name of a pin
   * BlueprintCallable: native function that can be called from a Blueprint
   * BlueprintPure: BlueprintCallable without side effects

 * [gameplay classes in unreal engine](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-classes-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.0)
   * Classes in Unreal Engine have a standardized naming scheme
   * "A" - AActor - Extends from the base class of spawnable gameplay objects. These are Actors, and can be spawned directly into the world.
   * "U" - UComponent - Extend from the base class of all gameplay objects. These are generally objects like Components
   * C++ Class Wizard/Class Headers with `#include "ClassName.generated.h"`
   * Class Declaration: UCLASS/GENERATED_BODY()
   * Class Specifiers: Abstract/etc.
   * Metadata Specifiers: BlueprintSpawnableComponent/etc.
   * Some constructors may be located in a special "constructors" file on a per-module basis. For example, the AActor::AActor constructor may be found in EngineConstructors.cpp. This is the result of an automatic conversion process from the previous use of a DEFAULTS block to the use of constructors.
   * It is also possible to place the constructor inline in the class header file. However, if the constructor is in the class header file, the UClass must be declared with the CustomConstructor
   * Constructor Format: `UMyObject::UMyObject()` or `UMyObject::UMyObject(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer)`
   * any initialization code written into the constructor will be applied to the CDO, and will therefore be copied to any new instances of the object created properly within the engine
   * The FObjectInitializer parameter that is passed into the constructor, despite being marked as const, can be configured via built-in mutable functions to override properties and subobjects
   * `ObjectInitializer.DoNotCreateDefaultSubobject()`
   * Constructor Statics and Helpers: ConstructorStatics
     * Asset References - ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder
     * Class References - FClassFinder
   * Components and Sub-Objects: Creating component subobjects and attaching them to the actor's hierarchy can also be done inside of the constructor; When spawning an actor, its components will be cloned from the CDO

   * do not confuse with C++ interface/abstract class
   * Declare an Interface in C++: UINTERFACE macro instead of the UCLASS; inherit from UInterface instead of UObject
   * UINTERFACE class is not the actual interface, but rather an empty class that provides visibility to the reflection system
   * UReactToTriggerInterface vs IReactToTriggerInterface + GENERATED_BODY()
   * the actual interface has the same name as the empty class, but the U-prefix is replaced by I
   * The Blueprintable specifier is required if you want a Blueprint to implement this interface
   * Interface Specifiers: MinimalAPI/BlueprintType/Blueprintable/DependsOn
   * Blueprint Callable Interface Functions:
     * Specify a UFUNCTION macro in the function’s declaration with the BlueprintCallable specifier
     * Use either the BlueprintImplementableEvent or BlueprintNativeEvent specifiers
     * Blueprint callable interface functions cannot be virtual
     * If your Blueprint callable function does not return a value, Unreal Engine treats your function as an event in Blueprint
   * Call a Blueprint Event from C++: `IReactToTriggerInterface::Execute_ReactToTrigger`
   * Determine Whether a Class Implements an Interface:
     * `OriginalObject->GetClass()->ImplementsInterface`
     * `OriginalObject->Implements<UReactToTriggerInterface>()`
     * `Cast<IReactToTriggerInterface>`
   * Cast to Other Unreal Types: casting system supports casting from one interface to another, or from an interface to an Unreal type where appropriate
   * Safely Store Object and Interface Pointers: TScriptInterface/FScriptInterface 
   * Blueprint Implementable Interfaces:
     * If you want a Blueprint to implement this interface, you must use the Blueprintable metadata specifier. Every interface function (other than static functions) must be a BlueprintNativeEvent or a BlueprintImplementableEvent.
     * From C++, only the Execute_ static wrapper functions will work properly

 * [objects in unreal engine](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/objects-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.0)
   * The base class for objects in Unreal is UObject
   * The UCLASS macro can be used to tag classes derived from UObject
   * UCLASS that describes its Unreal-based type
   * Each UCLASS maintains one Object called the Class Default Object (CDO)
   * UObject Creation: NewObject/CreateDefaultSubobject
   * UObjects should never use the new operator
   * Functionality Provided by UObjects
     - Garbage collection
     - Reference updating
     - Reflection
     - Serialization
     - Automatic updating of default property changes
     - Automatic property initialization
     - Automatic editor integration
     - Type information available at runtime
     - Network replication
   * UStructs are considered value types and are not garbage collected
   * The Unreal Header Tool: preprocessing step needs to be run on the header files
   * "Header File Format": MyObject.generated.h include, MYPROJECT_API, etc
   * When wrapping parts of a UCLASS with custom #ifdefs macros, UHT will ignore macros that do not contain WITH_EDITOR or WITHEDITORONLY_DATA macros
   * Updating Objects: ticking/FTickableGameObject/Tick()
   * Destroying Objects:
     - function MarkPendingKill() can be called directly on an Object; 
     - This function sets all pointers to the Object to NULL and removes the Object from global searches;
     - Object->MarkPendingKill() has been replaced with Obj->MarkAsGarbage()
     - related to gc.PendingKillEnabled=true
     - Strong references keep UObjects alive (TODO: test, more details)
     - IsValid() is for checking if it's null or garbage
     - Existing checks for nullptr should be replaced with IsValid()

   * You can then add, arrange, and customize Components
   * implement custom logic using a visual scripting languag
   * respond to Events and interactions
   * define custom Variables/etc

   * Automatic Property Initialization: UObjects are automatically zeroed on initialization
   * Automatic Updating of References:
     * When an AActor or UActorComponent is destroyed or otherwise removed from play, all references to it that are visible to the reflection system are automatically nulled; (TODO: not clear on UObject*)
     * UProperty pointers and pointers stored in Unreal Engine container classes such as TArray
   * Serialization:
     * UProperty values are automatically written or read unless explicitly marked as "transient" or unchanged from the post-constructor default value
     * UObject::Serialize - custom behavior
   * Updating of Property Values: When the Class Default Object (or CDO) of a UClass has changed, the engine will try to apply those changes to all instances of the class when they are loaded
   * Editor Integration: expose properties in Editor/Blueprints Editor/etc.
   * Run-Time Type Information and Casting: Cast<>
   * Garbage Collection:
     * The engine builds a reference graph to determine which UObjects are still in use
     * At the root of this graph is a set of UObjects designated as the "root set"
     * Any UObject can be added to the root set
     * Actors can be explicitly marked for destruction by calling their Destroy function
     * Components can be destroyed explicitly with the DestroyComponent function

   * Specific functions that a particular online service does not support will return Errors::NotImplemented
   * Event Callback and Listening: responds to requests as they finish/can query in-flight requests/uses a single code path
   * Interfaces: Achievements/Leaderboard/etc.
   * three different return types: TOnlineResult/TOnlineAsyncOpHandle/TOnlineEvent
   * TOnlineResult: Synchronous functions
   * TOnlineAsyncOpHandle: asynchronous
   * TOnlineEvent: Functions used for event listening 
   * two frameworks for accessing online services: Online Services and Online Subsystem
   * Online Services: have not been tested in shipping titles as of UE 5.1; recommend for developers targeting their own backend
   * OnlineServices Configuration
   * Run an Interface with a Console Command
